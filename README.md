## ABSTRACT
Heart failure is a serious medical condition that
affects millions of people worldwide and leads to
high mortality rates. Early prediction of heart failure
can greatly improve patient outcomes and reduce
healthcare costs. Machine learning techniques have
shown promising results in predicting heart failure.
This paper presents a review of various machine
learning algorithms that have been used to predict
heart failure, including decision trees, random
forests, k-nearest neighbors, artificial neural
networks, and support vector machines. The
performance of each algorithm is compared and
evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy,
sensitivity, and specificity. The results show that
machine learning algorithms can effectively predict
heart failure and can be used as a valuable tool for
healthcare professionals in the early diagnosis and
treatment of this condition. The paper concludes
with a discussion of the limitations of the current
studies and the future directions for the use of
machine learning in heart failure prediction. The
authors emphasize the need for further research to
validate the results and to improve the performance
of machine learning algorithms in predicting heart
failure. It is also important to consider the ethical
and privacy implications of using machine learning
algorithms in clinical practice.
